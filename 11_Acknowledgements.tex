\section{Acknowledgements}
The completion of this project would not have been possible without the dedicated supervisor efforts from
Mikkel Nørgaard Schmidt.\\

Mikkel Nørgaard Schmidts help has manifested through all of the stages of the project, from planning, to scoping,
to executing and finalizing. His inviting presence allows for curiosity to an extend very few prior of prior
supervisors have managed. His own curiosity towards the topic is contagious. His on the spot questioning and
advice, has contributed to the bettering of the project, and a deepening of the knowledge around the subject matter. \\

When things get tough, his calming manner gave the mental surplus that was needed to finalize the work, and deliver
on this project. \\

I would recommend his counselling efforts to any student at DTU, whether it being in a project or in a teaching capacity.\\

Thank you!\\
